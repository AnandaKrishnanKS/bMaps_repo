              This shit I&apos;m doing is bigger than you, do not interfere
              I&apos;m so far ahead of you niggas, it look like I&apos;m not even here
              Although my road is not even clear, I don&apos;t see no other option to steer
              I&apos;m going out as a legend, you know it, my envious enemies droppin&apos; a tear
              You should know I get it poppin&apos; by my name (I do)
              Man, these hoes ain&apos;t never rockin&apos; with no lames (who&apos;s that? That&apos;s you)
              Bitch, I&apos;m married to this motherfucking game (damn right! It&apos;s true)
              If you really think you got me in your aim (then shoot)
